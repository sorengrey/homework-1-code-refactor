For this homework assignment, the original HTML and CSS of a website needed to be refactored for accessibility and readability.
  <ul>
    <li>Non-semantic HTML and CSS tags needed to be replaced.</li>
    <li>Images needed to have alt text.</li>
    <li>Broken links needed to be fixed.</li>
    <li>CSS selectors needed to be consolidated and commented.</li>
    <li>Website needed to be deployed and live with no errors.</li>
  </ul>
  
  As someone new to coding, this project was a challenge. I had never heard of semantic code, but after reading about it and going over it in class, it made sense. I changed all the divs to sections in the HTML and CSS, making it more readable both to screen-readers, and anyone reading the code.<br><br>
  The images throughout the site did not have alt text, which would prevent screen-readers from telling a user what the images were. I added alt text for each of them.<br><br>
  All of the links worked aside from one, which was the Search Engine Optimization link in the navigation bar. It was supposed to jump to the paragraph below of the same name. In the HTML, only a class had been defined for the Search Engine Optimization section. I added an ID, which corresponded with the link's href address.<br><br>
  The CSS selectors were uncommented, so I made short comments that explained each element. There were also several groups of CSS selectors that were redundant and could be combined. I consolidated parts of the benefits and content sections, making the code shorter and less repetitive without changing what it does.<br><br>
  Deploying the website was probably the biggest challenge. I made many mistakes and ended up having to rewatch part of a class session to figure it out. But after the struggle, I got it sorted and the website is live. It is available [here](https://sorengrey.github.io/homework-1-code-refactor/).
